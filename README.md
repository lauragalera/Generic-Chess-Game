# GenericChessGame
Project of building a generic chess game in Java for the subject "Programming project" (graphic interface included in JavaFX, requires Java 8).

"generic" means that the movements of the pieces can be changed as pleased. For instance, a bishop could move like a queen or any sort of new movement could be included. However, there must be a king in every single game, with the highest weight. Please, check the json to see which features a piece must have.

The program detects check, checkmate and draw (for different cases explained in the documentation).

It also allows the player to play against the CPU or two CPU against each other. Moreover, it lets undo and redo as many movements as possible.

The game can be stopped and saved so later the players can continue with it, being saved in a json. Whenever the game finishes, the whole process will be saved as well.

DOC: Project requirements, tutorial of the program, report testing every important class, doxygen, classes UML diagram and a json for playtesting.

SRC: All the classes plus the pictures used.

JAR: jar to execute the program.

This project was done with a classmate.
